For Staging : EkaggaTheNews.war

Changes are:
------------------
If the user is logged into the Dashboard in one tab then any fresh tab will be open with List news page.
          The condition I have checked:-
Open dashboard
Type URL http://localhost:8080/NewsNib/ListNews.html
It should not be open directly without login.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
open dashboard
login there with the valid credential
now again open dashboard in another tab it should be open in list news page.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
open dashboard with two or three tab login in one tab and refresh all tab of the dashboard 
now log out in one tab 
refresh to all page
the result is in all tab page should be redirected in index page or landing page directly.
